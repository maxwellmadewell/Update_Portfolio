# Updated_Portfolio
This is a revised personal website based on html and css formatting with jquery javascript methods. The website has links to portfolio projects that I have written during my time in the Georgia Tech bootcamp. The website shows html script writing, css formatting, and jquery javascript functions for website development.

Challenges encounted relate to the layout of the html website and positioning of each individual element in an effort to make a blended website with advanced functionality.

Some of the easier technical challenges related to javascript functions such as on hover, click, on load, etc.

Going forward, I'm looking to further develop the navbar to make drop down pages, have a subnav bar that appears when the user has scrolled to the top of the page. I'm also looking to add more modals, and content links as well as have more subtle changes like on-hover of links/pictures.
